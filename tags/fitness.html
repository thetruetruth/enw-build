<h1 id=why-the-world-is-training-on-the-book-of-britains-most-brutal-prisoner>Why the world is training on the book of Britain&rsquo;s most brutal prisoner</h1>
<p>In the past 15 years, the fitness program of Briton Charles Bronson, who is serving a life sentence, has gained popularity. What is remarkable about the personality of the author, based on whose biography a film with Tom Hardy was made, and why the book written in prison has become a cult</p>
<p>Charles Bronson wrote a fitness book in prison in 2002. However, the book, authored by a prisoner who replaced more than 100 correctional institutions, gained wide popularity in the second decade of the 21st century. What is the reason for this success and who is the 69-year-old Bronson?</p>
<h2 id=why-prisons-refused-bronson>Why prisons refused Bronson</h2>
<p>The bestselling author grew up in a respectable English family. According to relatives, Michael Peterson (already in adulthood he will take the name Charles Bronson) &ldquo;was a smart boy, loved school and always got along well with his peers.&rdquo; “He never misbehaved and protected the weak,” his aunt Eileen Parry <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/646857.stm>told</a> the BBC.</p>
<p>The father of the future crime legend ran a Conservative party club in the Welsh university town of Aberystwyth, and an uncle and aunt were mayors of Luton in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Eileen Parry believes that her nephew was drawn into a life of crime after moving from Luton to Ellesmere Port, located 18 km from the criminal in the middle of the twentieth century Liverpool.</p>
<p>By the age of 13, the teenager joined a gang of four robbers, received a juvenile court conviction for theft, dropped out of school, and was often involved in street fights.</p>
<p>In 1972, when he was 19, he married (divorced five years later), became a father five months later, and at 22 was sentenced to seven years for armed assault.</p>
<p>While serving his first term, Peterson, due to his violent temper, changed many correctional institutions (during his criminal career he changed 120 places of detention in total) and several psychiatric hospitals. In 1986 alone, he was transferred eight times from prison to prison.</p>
<p>As a result, the first term stretched for ten years. After his release in 1987, he made his way to his native Luton for free by threatening drivers with a water gun, where he began his boxing career on the advice of promoter Reggie Cray, a legend in the London East End crime world.</p>
<p>The promoter came up with a pseudonym for him to increase his popularity. He performed under the name Charles Bronson, after the Hollywood actor.</p>
<p>However, the boxing career did not last long. Bronson spent 69 days at large. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, he gave his beloved Alison a ring by robbing a jewelry store. And seven days later he was arrested. The officers charged him under the name of Charles Bronson. At this point, he decided to drop the name Michael Peterson. Bronson was sent to Leicester Jail as similar establishments nearby refused to accept him due to his behaviour.</p>
<p>In 1992, Bronson was released again, where he spent 53 days this time. He was arrested for conspiracy to rob, but was soon released due to lack of evidence.</p>
<p>After 16 days, he was arrested again - for conspiracy to rob and possession of a sawn-off shotgun. While in custody, Bronson took the prison librarian hostage. He demanded an inflatable doll, a helicopter and a cup of tea. However, he freed the hostage because he &ldquo;felt disgusted&rdquo; with the victim because of the &ldquo;spoiled air&rdquo; by him.</p>
<p>In September 1993, he was sentenced to eight years. Bronson pleaded guilty to possession of the shotgun, but not to organizing the robbery. He told jurors that he intended to commit suicide with a sawed-off shotgun.</p>
<p>In the first six months of his third term, Bronson managed to once again change his place of residence and take hostage the deputy director of the prison in Hull. In the summer and autumn of 1994, a violent convict was transported from one prison to another once a week.</p>
<p>In 1996, an Iraqi plane hijacker shoved Bronson in the cafeteria and did not apologize. As <a href="https://books.google.ru/books?id=jyKtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT264&lpg=PT264&dq=charles+bronson+children+with+Down+syndrome&source=bl&ots=Y9_TLjyWc1&sig=ACfU3U3Jjxh7bpVUYkNY1Qqtld-MXUXgdg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS5vex54T3AhXjAxAIHZbIDtMQ6AF6BAgSEAM#v=snippet&q=Down%20syndrome&f=false">Bronson writes</a> in his autobiography, he held a grudge. And soon he took the hijacker himself, his accomplice and one Briton hostage. He made the Iraqis tickle his feet and call him &ldquo;the general.&rdquo; He demanded from the authorities a plane to Libya, two Uzi submachine guns, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, an ax and ice cream. The demands were not met, and after tens of hours he agreed to release all three.</p>
<p>Later, Bronson took hostage the director of one of the prisons, a doctor, a lawyer, and a prison teacher. In 1999, Bronson was sentenced to life in prison for taking a teacher hostage and destroying a prison. But that didn&rsquo;t stop him either. Later, he attacked 12 guards and beat the director of another prison.</p>
<h2 id=the-other-side-of-bronson>The Other Side of Bronson</h2>
<p>The 2009 film Bronson, in which Tom Hardy played him, brought wide fame to the dangerous prisoner. Bronson spent 42 of the last 48 years of his life in prison. In 2013, British Prime Minister David Cameron received a petition asking for his release, but it was not granted.</p>
<p>In 2001, Bronson married again, this time to Bangladeshi Fatima Rehman. She saw his photograph in the newspaper and started a correspondence with the brawler. Rehman worked at a women&rsquo;s shelter but was fired after her employer found out about their relationship.</p>
<p>Before getting married, Rehman visited Bronson ten times. The couple broke up four years later. And in 2017, Bronson proposed to actress Paula Williamson. They got married in November. And this marriage did not last long. In July 2018, Bronson filed for divorce after a frivolous photo of Williamson with a young Briton was published in the media.</p>
<p>According to the 37-year-old actress, she let 26-year-old Connor Boyce make sure that her breasts were not silicone. After the publication of the photo, Bronson ordered his wife to wear overalls in public places, but was refused. A year later, Williamson was found dead, the connection of death with Bronson was not established.</p>
<p>After his second marriage, Bronson converted to Islam and changed his name to Charles Ali Ahmed - however, he did this in violation of the law. Four years later he renounced Islam. In August 2014, Bronson changed his name for the third time - to Charles Salvador in honor of Salvador Dali. In his statement, he <a href=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/charles-bronson-art-up-for-auction-own-a-piece-of-original-work-by-one-of-britain-s-most-notorious-inmates-9762804.html>wrote</a> that he &ldquo;killed Bronson for good&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Under this name, he began <a href=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/charles-bronson-motorboating-paula-williamson-14936245>to write</a> poetry and paintings, which were exhibited in galleries, in the London Underground and at auctions. All proceeds from the sale of his work went mainly to charity.</p>
<h2 id=why-bronson-became-a-cult-author-among-fitness-enthusiasts>Why Bronson became a cult author among fitness enthusiasts</h2>
<p>Bronson has published more than ten books, one of which became a bestseller. While in prison, he developed a fitness program and in 2002 published the book &ldquo;Fitness in Solitary Confinement&rdquo;, detailing individual workouts with minimal resources and space. The book has become a desktop for many who decide to go in for fitness. The main reason for its popularity is simple: you can practice this program at home.</p>
<p>Bronson has repeatedly noted that a fitness club is not needed to build a sports figure. In 2008, he boasted that he could still do 172 push-ups in 60 seconds and 94 sit-ups in 30.</p>
<p>“I am the king of push-ups and squats,” Bronson said. “I already said that I once did 25 push-ups with two men on my back and squatted with three men on my shoulders!” For as long as I can remember, I have kept prison fitness records. Show me another man, half my age, who can lift a full-size pool table. I can. Show me another guy who can do 1727 pushups in an hour. I can&mldr; I once went eight years without weights, then went to the gym and squeezed 300 pounds ten times. I am 5ft 11in, weigh 220lbs and feel as strong as I did at 21&mldr; Something deep inside pushes me forward. I&rsquo;m a lone fitness survivor."</p>
<h2 id=what-you-need-to-know-about-bronsons-training-program>What you need to know about Bronson&rsquo;s training program</h2>
<p>The Bronson Course consists of effective exercises that can be performed in any indoor or outdoor area. The undeniable advantages of training with your own weight include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercises can be done at any convenient time and anywhere, be it an apartment, office or outdoor playground;</li>
<li>No need to pay for a visit to a fitness club and purchase special sports equipment;</li>
<li>These workouts combine strength and cardio.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=basic-bodyweight-exercises>Basic bodyweight exercises:</h3>
<ul>
<li>push ups;</li>
<li>pull-ups;</li>
<li>squats;</li>
<li>dives on uneven bars;</li>
<li>hanging leg raises;</li>
<li>burpee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bronson&rsquo;s variant of the six basic exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li>push-ups with a narrow setting of hands / push-ups with a wide setting of hands;</li>
<li>wide grip pull-ups / &ldquo;saboteur&rdquo; pull-ups;</li>
<li>shoulder-width squat - arms straighten forward / shoulder-width squat - hands on the back of the head / squat with bouncing when lifting;</li>
<li>dives with the support of hands on the bars;</li>
<li>hanging leg raises with straight legs / with legs bent at the knees;</li>
<li>burpee / burpee jump up.</li>
</ul>
<p>These exercises are recommended to be varied and performed in the format of a circuit training - that is, one after the other. The number of repetitions in each approach is determined independently, based on the level of your training. The following version of Bronson&rsquo;s circuit training is possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>push-ups with a wide setting of hands;</li>
<li>squats with legs shoulder-width apart - arms forward (distinctive feature: when lowering, a ten-second delay is performed for static muscle tension);</li>
<li>burpee (three movements must be performed: first a deep squat, then a plank followed by a push-up, then a return to a deep squat and a jump up from it);</li>
<li>press exercise - lifting the body from a prone position.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bronson workout is one example of a bodyweight exercise that you can vary, modify, and augment to suit your own preferences and fitness level.</p>

<h2>What is important to know about exercising during pregnancy. Doctors' advice</h2>

<h1 id=what-is-important-to-know-about-exercising-during-pregnancy-doctors-advice>What is important to know about exercising during pregnancy. Doctors' advice</h1>
<p>Moderate loads, if the pregnancy proceeds without complications, you do not need to be afraid. But the frequency and intensity of training should be discussed with your doctor. Details - in the material below.</p>
<p>Physical activity during pregnancy is necessary, at least if there are no contraindications. RBC Sport talked to doctors about which activities are best for which period and what is important to consider in the training process.</p>
<p>The following answered the questions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fidan Lyatifova - head of the department at the MEDSI clinic, obstetrician-gynecologist, ultrasound diagnostician;</li>
<li>Tatyana Dubenko is a leading gynecologist of the Family Doctor network of medical clinics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=fidan-latifova>Fidan Latifova</h2>
<p>Pregnancy is a special period in the life of any woman. At this time, she is responsible not only for her own life and health, but also for the life and health of the unborn child. Moderate training in the fitness room, provided that the pregnancy proceeds without complications, you should not be afraid.</p>
<p>A sedentary lifestyle of a pregnant woman - unless, of course, it is caused by medical indications - can lead to a weakening of muscle tone, an insufficient supply of oxygen to the body, poor labor activity and other complications. Therefore, during pregnancy, do not forget about physical activity.</p>
<p>Increased physical activity in the first trimester of pregnancy, when it is not yet stable, can adversely affect its course. To determine the frequency and intensity of physical activity, you must first seek advice from your gynecologist in charge of pregnancy and find out the presence or absence of contraindications for exercise. If nothing threatens the health of the future mother and baby and there are no contraindications, then it is possible to start training in a gentle mode, changing the training program in accordance with the trimester.</p>
<p>Doctors disagree on when it is worth starting to play sports: many are against loads up to 13 weeks, and this is justified, because the main “critical periods” of pregnancy are observed exactly up to 13 weeks. And from the 13-15th week you can already start. In the first trimester, you should not start doing any new sport for yourself. The best activities for this period are walking, swimming, performing special breathing exercises.</p>
<p>In the second trimester, the pregnant woman feels noticeably better, toxicosis is already receding, this period is most favorable for activity. You can, for example, attend special classes for pregnant women with an instructor, yoga, Pilates for pregnant women, cardio training - an exercise bike, swimming, walking are also suitable.</p>
<p>In the third trimester, physical activity should be moderate and aimed at preparing for childbirth - after all, the child grows and affects the musculoskeletal system of the expectant mother. Moderate fitness training at this time will have a beneficial effect on the well-being of the pregnant woman, swelling will go away, blood circulation will improve, which means that this is a good prevention of preeclampsia. In addition, the load on the lower back is reduced, back pain disappears. Properly selected exercises also improve heart function and prevent large weight gain.</p>
<p>For professional athletes who were actively involved in sports before pregnancy, the situation is not so clear. Recently, a group of Norwegian scientists conducted a study on this topic. An impressive review <a href=https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/10/571>published</a> in five parts in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Understanding the details of the study is not easy, but the main message of the authors is clear: such expectant mothers can continue to actively engage in sports.</p>
<p>Athletes are not in a more risky position than other pregnant women. As the authors of the study note, athletes also have problems during pregnancy or childbirth, but it would be a mistake to associate this with physical activity during gestation. At the same time, there is no evidence that pregnancy and childbirth in athletes are easier.</p>
<p>Much here depends on the individual characteristics of the organism. Therefore, the possibility of training and their intensity during pregnancy should be discussed with an obstetrician-gynecologist, even if before pregnancy you were at the top of the sports Olympus.</p>
<h2 id=tatiana-dubenko>Tatiana Dubenko</h2>
<p>Physical activity during pregnancy is necessary, so it is possible to play sports during pregnancy. However, such exercises are allowed only with the permission of the obstetrician-gynecologist observing the patient, and with the careful supervision of the trainer. Not intensive, sparing, but regular loads are preferred. They allow you to keep pregnant mobility, reduce the risk of various chronic diseases, as well as complications in the mother and her child during childbirth.</p>
<p>Sports allow you to keep the muscles in good shape, provide the fetus with enough oxygen. In active, athletic mothers, children are born with good cardiac activity and a sufficiently formed nervous system. Such children are mentally more stable and often ahead of their peers in development.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that some types of active sports during pregnancy are strictly prohibited - skating, rollerblading, ball games (basketball, volleyball, football), skiing, cycling, horseback riding. Preference is given to activities such as swimming, yoga, Pilates.</p>
<p>For pregnant women who did not play sports before pregnancy, it is better to start classes in the second trimester. If a woman went in for sports before pregnancy, it is necessary to reduce physical activity to 70-80% of the previous intensity. During pregnancy, it is not recommended to introduce new exercises, despite the fact that it may seem that the body&rsquo;s capabilities have increased (there is an increase in joint mobility, which is associated with increased production of hormones for carrying a pregnancy).</p>
