<p>Moderate loads, if the pregnancy proceeds without complications, you do not need to be afraid. But the frequency and intensity of training should be discussed with your doctor. Details - in the material below.</p>
<p>Physical activity during pregnancy is necessary, at least if there are no contraindications. RBC Sport talked to doctors about which activities are best for which period and what is important to consider in the training process.</p>
<p>The following answered the questions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fidan Lyatifova - head of the department at the MEDSI clinic, obstetrician-gynecologist, ultrasound diagnostician;</li>
<li>Tatyana Dubenko is a leading gynecologist of the Family Doctor network of medical clinics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=fidan-latifova>Fidan Latifova</h2>
<p>Pregnancy is a special period in the life of any woman. At this time, she is responsible not only for her own life and health, but also for the life and health of the unborn child. Moderate training in the fitness room, provided that the pregnancy proceeds without complications, you should not be afraid.</p>
<p>A sedentary lifestyle of a pregnant woman - unless, of course, it is caused by medical indications - can lead to a weakening of muscle tone, an insufficient supply of oxygen to the body, poor labor activity and other complications. Therefore, during pregnancy, do not forget about physical activity.</p>
<p>Increased physical activity in the first trimester of pregnancy, when it is not yet stable, can adversely affect its course. To determine the frequency and intensity of physical activity, you must first seek advice from your gynecologist in charge of pregnancy and find out the presence or absence of contraindications for exercise. If nothing threatens the health of the future mother and baby and there are no contraindications, then it is possible to start training in a gentle mode, changing the training program in accordance with the trimester.</p>
<p>Doctors disagree on when it is worth starting to play sports: many are against loads up to 13 weeks, and this is justified, because the main “critical periods” of pregnancy are observed exactly up to 13 weeks. And from the 13-15th week you can already start. In the first trimester, you should not start doing any new sport for yourself. The best activities for this period are walking, swimming, performing special breathing exercises.</p>
<p>In the second trimester, the pregnant woman feels noticeably better, toxicosis is already receding, this period is most favorable for activity. You can, for example, attend special classes for pregnant women with an instructor, yoga, Pilates for pregnant women, cardio training - an exercise bike, swimming, walking are also suitable.</p>
<p>In the third trimester, physical activity should be moderate and aimed at preparing for childbirth - after all, the child grows and affects the musculoskeletal system of the expectant mother. Moderate fitness training at this time will have a beneficial effect on the well-being of the pregnant woman, swelling will go away, blood circulation will improve, which means that this is a good prevention of preeclampsia. In addition, the load on the lower back is reduced, back pain disappears. Properly selected exercises also improve heart function and prevent large weight gain.</p>
<p>For professional athletes who were actively involved in sports before pregnancy, the situation is not so clear. Recently, a group of Norwegian scientists conducted a study on this topic. An impressive review <a href=https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/10/571>published</a> in five parts in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Understanding the details of the study is not easy, but the main message of the authors is clear: such expectant mothers can continue to actively engage in sports.</p>
<p>Athletes are not in a more risky position than other pregnant women. As the authors of the study note, athletes also have problems during pregnancy or childbirth, but it would be a mistake to associate this with physical activity during gestation. At the same time, there is no evidence that pregnancy and childbirth in athletes are easier.</p>
<p>Much here depends on the individual characteristics of the organism. Therefore, the possibility of training and their intensity during pregnancy should be discussed with an obstetrician-gynecologist, even if before pregnancy you were at the top of the sports Olympus.</p>
<h2 id=tatiana-dubenko>Tatiana Dubenko</h2>
<p>Physical activity during pregnancy is necessary, so it is possible to play sports during pregnancy. However, such exercises are allowed only with the permission of the obstetrician-gynecologist observing the patient, and with the careful supervision of the trainer. Not intensive, sparing, but regular loads are preferred. They allow you to keep pregnant mobility, reduce the risk of various chronic diseases, as well as complications in the mother and her child during childbirth.</p>
<p>Sports allow you to keep the muscles in good shape, provide the fetus with enough oxygen. In active, athletic mothers, children are born with good cardiac activity and a sufficiently formed nervous system. Such children are mentally more stable and often ahead of their peers in development.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that some types of active sports during pregnancy are strictly prohibited - skating, rollerblading, ball games (basketball, volleyball, football), skiing, cycling, horseback riding. Preference is given to activities such as swimming, yoga, Pilates.</p>
<p>For pregnant women who did not play sports before pregnancy, it is better to start classes in the second trimester. If a woman went in for sports before pregnancy, it is necessary to reduce physical activity to 70-80% of the previous intensity. During pregnancy, it is not recommended to introduce new exercises, despite the fact that it may seem that the body&rsquo;s capabilities have increased (there is an increase in joint mobility, which is associated with increased production of hormones for carrying a pregnancy).</p>
